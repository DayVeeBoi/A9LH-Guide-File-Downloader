# A9LH-Guide-File-Downloader
A utility to download files associated with the A9LH guide

To-do
* ~add path info to database~ (done, except for going through the magnet links) ~and make default be root when inserting new row in script~
* add firmware and region info to database manually (partially done)
* add name (text in link) to database in script
* add message section to display any warnings (e.g. file info not known, path info not known etc)
* find out how to get the script to run anytime there is an update to the guide
* implement search feature (low priority)
* have pages not display & files not added to list if timestamp is older than the others
* make status window be able to change size to fit progress bar + name, or, get progress bar to be underneath name label
* make files be extracted to the path specified
* find out how to send myself a text message if there is a page with 'unknown' (so I need to add a filename to it)
* make a web page where I can enter in details and submit without having to open up CPanel etc
* have a button for users to submit bugs/errors from the program
* ~make script not look for an updated file if the domains do not match~
* add individual downloads for ropbin instead of user needing to visit the page (unlikely, too complicated)
