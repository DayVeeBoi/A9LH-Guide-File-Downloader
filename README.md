# A9LH-Guide-File-Downloader
A utility to download files associated with the A9LH guide

## How to use it

* You'll need to [install Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml) first, if you don't have it.
* Put it on your SD card if you want the files downloaded directly there, or you can run it from anywhere and copy the files over later.
* Double-click on it to open it. Give it a few seconds because it is getting info from the internet to populate the page list.
* Choose your console type, region, and firmware from the drop-down boxes if any of the files are console dependent, or leave it at 'All' and have a look at the files before proceeding to make sure you delete any files that aren't for you.
* Double-check the files against what it says in the guide to make sure nothing went wrong. If something did go wrong, please report it using the "Report a problem" button so it can be fixed ASAP.
* If you have a suggestion, please use GitHub issues or [message me on GBATemp](https://gbatemp.net/conversations/add?to=Quantumcat&title=Suggestion).
